name,description,enum
name,"The name of a variable (i.e., field) as it appears in the data",
description,An extended description of the variable,
module,"Module (a place to put the section, form, or other broad category used to group variables)",
title,The human-readable title of the variable,
type,"A classification allowing the user (analyst, researcher or computer) to know how to use the variable","""boolean"", ""any"", ""date"", ""yearmonth"", ""string"", ""integer"", ""duration"",      ""number"",  ""geopoint"", ""time"", ""datetime"", ""year"""
format,Indicates the format of the type specified in the `type` property. This may describe the type of unit (such as for time fields like year or month) or the format of a date field (such as %y%m%d),
constraints.maxLength,"Indicates the maximum length of an iterable (e.g., array, string, or object). For example, if 'Hello World' is the longest value of a categorical variable, this would be a maxLength of 11",
constraints.enum,Constrains possible values to a set of values,
constraints.pattern,A regular expression pattern the data MUST conform to,
constraints.maximum,"Specifies the maximum value of a field (e.g., maximum -- or most recent -- date, maximum integer etc). Note, this is different then maxLength property.",
encodings,"Encodings (and mappings) allow categorical values to be stored as numerical values. IMPORTANT: the key should be the value represented IN the data and the value should be the to-be-mapped label . Many analytic software programs use numerical encodings and some algorithms only support numerical values. Additionally, this field provides a way to store categoricals that are stored as  ""short "" labels (such as abbreviations)",
ordered,"Indicates whether a categorical variable is ordered. This variable is relevant for variables that have an ordered relationship but not necessarily a numerical relationship (e.g., Strongly disagree < Disagree < Neutral < Agree).",
missingValues,A list of missing values specific to a variable,
trueValues,"For boolean (true) variable (as defined in type field), this field allows a physical string representation to be cast as true (increasing readability of the field). It can include one or more values.",
falseValues,"For boolean (false) variable (as defined in type field), this field allows a physical string representation to be cast as false (increasing readability of the field) that is not a standard false value. It can include one or more values.",
repo_link,"A link to the variable as it exists on the home repository, if applicable",
cde_id,The source and id for the NIH Common Data Elements program,
ontology_id,"Ontological information for the given variable as indicated by the source, id, and relation to the specified classification. One or more ontology classifications can be specified.",
univar_stats.median,actual median of numeric variable data,
univar_stats.mean,actual mean of numeric variable data,
univar_stats.std,actual standard deviation of numeric variable data,
univar_stats.min,actual minimum of numeric variable data,
univar_stats.max,actual max of numeric variable data,
univar_stats.mode,actual mode of numeric variable data,
univar_stats.count,actual count of non-missing occurrence for any variable type data,
univar_stats.twenty_five_percentile,actual 25th percentile for numeric variable data,
univar_stats.seventy_five_percentile,actual 75th percentile for numeric variable data,
univar_stats.cat_marginals,actual count of occurrence of each category for categorical variable data,
